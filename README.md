# Flash-Card-Project
A program that will provide flash cards for studying a foreign language.

The program is currently set up for English speakers learning French. It currently pulls French words and meanings from a csv file. This could be converted to pull from a website at random, but that is not the current functionality. Currently, a French word will appear and then in 3 seconds the flash card will slip to the English meaning. The user can then choose the check mark if they got it right or the "x" if they got it wrong. If they got it right, then it will be removed from the list so they don't waste time studying words they already know.
